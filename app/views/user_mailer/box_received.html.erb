Dear <%= @box.user.first_name %> <%= @box.user.last_name %>,
<br><br>
We just wanted to inform you that we have received your box, number <%= @box.id %>, here at The Visible Closet world headquarters!
<br><br>
<% if @box.box_type == Box::CUST_BOX_TYPE %>
We have measured your box, and found that it is a healthy <%= @box.cubic_feet %> cubic feet in size.<br><br>
	<% if @box.indexing_status != Box::NO_INDEXING_REQUESTED %>
	We also see that you have selected to inventory your box -- a fine idea! Our staff are hard at work processing your inventory, and will notify you when the process is complete.<br><br>
	<% end %>
Given this box's size and indexing status, your monthly fee to store this box will be $<%= @box.monthly_fee %>. For the current month, the fee will be prorated starting on <%= @box.received_at.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") %>, the date it was received.
<% end %>
<br><br>
Thanks for using The Visible Closet, and have a great day!
<br><br>
