	<b>Why am I ordering my own box?</b><br><br>We want to make sure that when we receive your box we know who sent it! <br>By clicking "Store My Stuff" you will create a record of your box in your account, and receive instructions on how to ship it. <br>You can also track your box while it's in transit, and name the box for your own reference.

	<b>How does inventorying work?</b><br><br>Most customers don't know how much of their stuff they want to inventory until they pack their boxes. We therefore don't require that you pay for inventorying up front. <br><br>Instead, we stamp our boxes with an indicator so you can choose whether to inventory when you pack the box. If you mark the indicator, then as soon as we receive the box we will inventory it for you, and your storage rate will be adjusted accordingly. <br><br>You can also choose to inventory a box while it is in storage via the "Browse Boxes" section of the website.

<div id="vc_box_inline" style="text-align: center"><b>Why am I paying for this box?</b><br><br>Ordering a box from The Visible Closet requires that you pay your first month's rent up front. <br>Once you complete your order we will send you your free shipping materials. <br>You do not pay any more storage costs until your box has been in storage for one month.</div>

<div id="plan_inline" style="text-align: center"><b>Why am I paying right now?</b><br><br>You have signed up for a multi-month plan, which gets you access to your free shipping voucher(s). All multi-month plans require that you pay your first three months' rent up front. Any subsequent months in your plan will be billed at the price indicated in the "Cost" column. At the end of your plan you can either sign up for another plan or switch to monthly billing (see <a href="/pricing">pricing</a> page for details on pricing for other plans and for the month-to-month option).</div>
