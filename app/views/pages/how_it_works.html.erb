	We can store just about anything, with a few <a href="/restrictions">exceptions</a>. You have three options, and can mix and match options as you please:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Your Boxes</b> -- If you have your own boxes you can ship them to us. Just select the number of boxes you wish to ship, and we will provide Fedex shipping labels for you to print and attach to your boxes.</li>
		<li><b>Our Boxes</b> -- Need boxes? No problem! Choose the number you need and we will Fedex them to you, along with shipping supplies.</li>
		<li><b>Odd Storage - CHICAGO AREA ONLY</b> -- If you are in the Chicago area you can store things that don't fit in a box and can't be easily mailed by dropping them off in person. Odd storage is available on an appointment basis only at this time. <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> for more info.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="simple_body">
	As you finish packing, indicate on the box (for our boxes) or the shipping label (your boxes) whether you would like the contents of the box inventoried. You can also do this at any time your boxes are in storage.

	5. EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC
	</div>
	<div class="simple_body">
	<p>It's pretty awesome to be able to just store by the box! No trip to the storage facility, no renting more space than you need ... pretty nice.</p><p> But to experience the real magic, get your boxes inventoried! Once we have your boxes and have inventoried them you can see your stuff ... search for individual items ... mail individual items, donate them, even sell them ... all with the click of a button!</p>
