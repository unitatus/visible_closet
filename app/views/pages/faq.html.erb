	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br><Br>
	
	<p class="q">Q: What does "inventorying" mean?</p>
	<p>A: Inventorying is an optional service provided by The Visible Closet. If you choose to inventory, we will open your box, take pictures of the items inside, "tag" each picture with a series of text descriptions, and post the pictures to your account so you can easily see what you have in storage, search for items, and manage items individually.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: What does "tagging" mean?</p>
	<p>A: Tagging is that act of associating certain words with the items you have in storage. For instance, if you put a pair of white sneakers in storage, we might tag them with the words "sneaker", "white", and "shoe". You could then enter "shoe" in the site search and find them. Note that you can add to or remove tags for your items as well.</p>
	
	<p class="q">Q: Can I tag my items?</p>
	<p>A: Certainly! Just go into the "details" menu for an item by mousing over its picture to enter or remove tags.</p>
	
	<p class="q">Q: Do I have to choose the inventory option?</p>
	<p>A: Absolutely not! We only inventory the boxes that you have chosen to be inventoried. Any boxes not marked for inventorying are never opened by us.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: What does "manage items individually" mean?</p>
	<p>A: The services we plan to offer include selling items, shipping items to an address of your choosing, donating items to charity, and environmentally sustainable disposal of items. All of these services are only available if you have chosen to inventory a box.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: Do you ship internationally?</p>
	<p>A: We are working on it! We plan to offer this option soon. At this time, however, we only ship within the United States.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: How do I ship my box to you?</p>
	<p>A: First, sign up to have your box stored. Once you have done so, you will have the opportunity to print out a Fedex shipping label. Print that on any printer, affix it to your box, and contact Fedex at 1-800-GO-FEDEX to schedule an appointment to have your box picked up (or visit any of Fedex's many locations to drop it off). If you have committed to a subscription, then you are done! If you have not, you will be billed later for shipping costs once we receive those from FedEx.</p>

	<p class="q">Q: Can I ship my boxes using another carrier besides FedEx?</p>
	<p>A: Sure! Just be sure to do the following:
<ol>
	<li>Order your box via www.thevisiblecloset.com first. That way we know it's coming. Once you do that, you will have the box "in inventory", waiting to be shipped by you.</li>

	<li>Write down your order number on the outside of your box like so: ORDER # 4. This is so we know who sent the box. The order number can be found on the invoice you will receive at your email address when you order your box.</li>
	
	<li>If you would like your box to be inventoried, please write "inventorying requested" on the outside of the box.</li>

	<li>Ship to the following address:
<div style="padding: 10px 0 0 15px"
<%= raw vc_address %>
</div>
	<insert address from configuration>
		</li>
		</p>
	<p class="q">Q: Can I ship The Visible Closet boxes using another carrier?</p>

	<p>A: Depends on the box. If you have chosen to store one or more Visible Closet boxes we will send you your free box and shipping materials immediately, and charge you a prepayment in the amount of your first month's rent (this prepayment will apply to any charges on your account, not just the charge for your first month's rent for that box). The clock doesn't start ticking on your second month's rent until we receive your box(es). If you choose to store a box that you supply, you should "order" it so you get the shipping information and set up payment terms, but you don't pay anything until we receive your box.</p>
	
	<p class="q">Q: How do I go about storing my own box?</p>
	<p>A: We ask that you go through the "ordering" process by choosing the "Store More Stuff" option on the Account menu.

Armed with the shipping information, you can mail in your box whenever you want!</p>
