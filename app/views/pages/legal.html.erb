Refund Policy 
</div>
<div class="simple_body">
<p>This Refund Policy applies to all credit card payments.   The Visible Closet will only issue refunds on credit card payments in cases of fraud or at The Visible Closet's discretion. Requests for Refunds should be made no later than 45 days after the payment posts to the customerâs account. Requests submitted after 45 days will not be refunded.</p>
<p>A valid reason is required for refund. In cases of fraud, the customer must submit a signed affidavit from the bank or the agency issuing the credit card. We are typically more inclined to refund payments where fraud can easily be determined, but we do not accommodate users of The Visible Closet that ask for a refund upon completing the payment entry and deciding that the payment should have been on a different card.</p>
 <p>
Reasons for disqualifying a refund are listed below:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>Inability to report fraudulent payments within 45 days will disqualify the Request for Refund.</li>
	<li>Third party website blocking you or The Visible Closet from accessing their site. If you visit a site and that site ends up blocking your or The Visible Closet's servers, that is not grounds for refund.</li>
	<li>Data input errors by the operator or changes to your computer that prevent you from using thevisiblecloset.com's services will not be cause for refund. Note such changes can be caused by new software, upgrades, or operator error.</li>
	<li>We do not refund prepaid rent.</li>
</ul>
